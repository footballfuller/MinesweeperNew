Clicking the "XML Parse" button looks in the minesweeper.xml file and gets an x coordinate and a y coordinate. 
That information displays on right then those coordinates are put into my function that draws a grid. 
The coordinates given to it display a clicked square instead of a normal one. You can change the number
in the minesweeper.xml file to change the square clicked it just needs to be between 0 and 8 because of the current grid size.
Launch gamePage.html in firefox to get started.
